alias -> creates new aliasinternalhandler with data "nameoforiginalhandler", and assigns it to the handler datastructure with name "name given"
aliasinternalhandler -> snips off the first entry in t, creates a new tokenstream2 with "nameoforiginalhandler" (taken from data), then extends it with t. Calls the handler called "name given" with the new tokenstream; returns that.

$(marker "name" => {value},...)
$(runMarkers location name*)

macro_rules! matcher... to activate on a series of tokens and then pass through the values to an inner bit of code

Args in vecs
with arrays that list offsets in to that vec, so we can go by unnamed or named

for inner and outer:
  vec of positions (with named coming in at the end from left to right)
  vec of Names (with nameless being $0, $1, $2 etc based on positions for $ as sigil)

vec of default values

get arg values from caller to populate actual values based on args, push all of those to env, then got through defaults pushing in to the environment left-to-right in the declaration

try_and, try_or, try_one_until_first_success, try_all_until_first_failure
parse_str <- takes a string and turns it into a TokenStream2 or fails
file_str <- return a string with the contents of a file
parse_file <- conceptually $(parse_str $(file_str ...)) but able to print the filename in the error

Note to self:
Check whether the c,v smuggling *actually* works - my hunch is that it won't, as the 'timing' of stage execution doesn't match up.
If so, rehydrate *inside* the proc macro, by adding a TokenTree:Group to the start of the TokenStream that containst the configuration and variables

Add a 'FromTokens'/'rehydrate' trait, which lets you instantiate the thing from a tokenstream

Always instantiate Configuration<T> as Configuration<DoMarker> as we won't be using this for things with new preludes

Add a 'FromTokens'-y stash as a TokenStream that the handlers will have access to; this can be used for eg code to be interpreted by an interpreter handler rather than trying to rez the whole thing from a token stream per se.

The environment

- configuration
  * are handlers allowed
  * what is the variable sigil
  * what is the code sigil
  * what handlers are there
  * what are the 'do', 'with', and 'in' identifiers, and are 'with' and 'in' allowed
  * What is the default 'with' and 'in' tokenstream?
- variables in two namespaces
  * set by $ ways eg in 'with', inside a function defined in 'with' via its arg list
  * set by % ways eg by a handler

Handlers

%(...) sends ... plus the environment to a handler, picked based on the first token in ...
Handlers get registered. A set of defaults provides for, if/else, etc



#[proc_macro_attribute]
fn make_do(args: TokenStream, body: TokenStream) -> TokenStream {

}


#[proc_macro]
fn do_with_in(t: TokenStream) -> TokenStream {
  let mut handlers: HashMap<String, 
}

Collapse into single namespace? with/in become just handlers too? Handlers return (TokenStream, Variables) and so can do things like add in new variables? Handlers are taken care of in the same place/way as variables?

What about difference between ⌜$foo(bar, Baz, [quux, n, m])⌝ vs ⌜in { }⌝ vs ⌜$(for $i in ... { })⌝ vs ⌜$(if $i is empty { } else { })⌝?

What if I make it all $(foo bar baz quux)

No, lets just have

$a for simple substitutions, and $(a ...) for a(...)=...

fn each_with_variable_maker(args: ArgList, body: Body) -> Handler {
  |c: Configuration, v: Variables, t: TokenStream| {
    (v, t)
  }
}
